### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
In this section, we analyze two charts that were generated from the file “Kickstater_Challenge.xlsx”

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the Launch Date, (1) the most successful campaign was created around May and June and (2) the average of failure is 41 during the year.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the Outcomes, the lower the expectation means usually a higher rate to achieve a successful result.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The lack of data is a limitation since we have under 80 entries for December.

The goal can be set at $1.00 which end up generating campaign with a success rate over %500.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Theatre could be influenced by the weather. Another chart could be to analyze the success rate from each country.
