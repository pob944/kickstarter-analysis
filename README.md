# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project analyzed what could make a campaign successfull for the kickstarters/crowdfundings projects. The dataset used 4,086 campaigns ranging from 2014 to 2016 in the theater category from Australia, Canada, France, Great Britain, United States. The conclusion seems to indicate a need to lower the budget target and launch her play in May or June in order to increase the  probability of success based on historical data.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project analyzed and find out if there was a relation for each campaign launch datae during the year for the parent category theater and the campaign budget goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
In this section, we analyze two charts that were generated from the file “Kickstater_Challenge.xlsx”

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Base on 1,369 campaigns launched in the subcategory "play", 839 (61%) were successfull and 493 failed (36%). The mode is May and the Median is also May, but June is close at 100 successfull campaigns vs 111 for May.

### Challenges Encountered
The campaign can be done by using the radio, flyers and so on. In our case, the difficulties are how we can spend the money to be the most efficient. The challenges are to determine the way to will garder the public attention and for how many days/months Louise can do it.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Alt text](/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

The majority of the successfull are grouped in the [Less Than 1000], [1,000 to 4,999] and [5,000 to 9,999]. In order to help Louis, we need to focus on the range [10,000 to 14,999] since her target is 12,000. With that said, she will need to be diligent on her campaign since the rate of success is 54% and the rates of failes is 46%. The  conclusion of this charts is lowering the target seems to help the rate of sucess in meeting the campaign goal.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge in order to better asses the quality of a successfull campaing would be to know how the campaign was done. The dataset doesn't let us know if a campaign was done by using the radio, flyers and so on. The methode used and the duration could provide a better insight in order to help Louise on the way to advertise her campaign. 

## Results

###  What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the table "Outcomes based on Launch Date",  (1) the most successful campaigns were created around May and June and (2) the failure rate is steady at an average of 41 for the 12 months.


### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the Outcomes, the lower the expectation means usually a higher rate to achieve a successful result which seems to be confirmed by a rate of 141 (also the mode) for the group with a target of [Less Than 1000].


### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The lack of data is a limitation since we have under 75 entries for December vs 166 for May.

There is no realistic minimum for the campaign target. The goal can be set at $1.00 which end up generating campaign with a success rate over 500%.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
From my personnal experience, the theatre industry seems to be influenced by the weather. Another chart could be to analyze the success rate from each country.
